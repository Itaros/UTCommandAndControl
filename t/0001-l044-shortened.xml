 <t id="11315">(l / xl detected)Size doesn't matter. Hopefully.</t>
 <t id="11316">If you want to be welcomed by some bigger ships, here's your chance.</t>
 <t id="11317">A few of these ships could be a challenge.</t>
 <t id="11318">If we want take out the big ones we need a good plan.</t>
 <t id="11319">This zone is full of surprises, big ones.</t>
 <t id="11320">(station detected)I don't think that station likes us very much.</t>
 <t id="11325">(mine detected)Don't get too close!</t>
 <t id="11326">You know better than getting close to mines, right?</t>
 <t id="11340">They're gonna get a nice surprise.</t>
 <t id="11341">Let them come.</t>
 <t id="11342">Seriously? Bring them on!</t>
 <t id="11343">Shouldn't be a problem.</t>
 <t id="11344">OK, let's see what they want to do.</t>
 <t id="11345">Are they serious?</t>
 <t id="11346">Really?</t>
 <t id="11347">Looks like an easy fight.</t>
 <t id="11350">Unmanned ships approaching!</t>
 <t id="11351">Drones on the way! Not friendly.</t>
 <t id="11352">Let's turn them into space trash.</t>
 <t id="11355">We have to get out of here!</t>
 <t id="11356">(continuing)Haha, just kidding! Let's have fun.</t>
 <t id="11357">Get ready for an epic fight!</t>
 <t id="11358">This'll be an interesting story to tell, assuming we live long enough.</t>
 <t id="11360">Hope it doesn't jump away before we're done.</t>
 <t id="11365">Do they really want to build something in our territory? That ain't gonna end well for them.</t>
 <t id="11366">We'd better take it out or they'll build something right under our noses.</t>
 <t id="11380">Avoid the crossfire.</t>
 <t id="11381">Watch out for incoming fire.</t>
 <t id="11385">(Flak in range)Expect fireworks any second.</t>
 <t id="11386">Keeping a lookout for launches.</t>
 <t id="11390">We can only do so much dodging. Get close to the surface!</t>
 <t id="11391">Light turrets have us in their sights!</t>
 <t id="11392">Not a problem if we can exploit their turning speed.</t>
 <t id="11393">Some of those turrets can deal some damage if we don't evade.</t>
 <t id="11395">Keep moving. Don't let them get a lock.</t>
 <t id="11396">If we stay still we can get taken out.</t>
 <t id="11400">Like fireflies. Big ones.</t>
 <t id="11401">Look at that mess.</t>
 <t id="11402">Like kids playing...</t>
 <t id="11403">Let's see if we can help...or grab some loot.</t>
 <t id="11410">(drone lost)Hope they've got more drones.</t>
 <t id="11411">(drone lost)Bye bye, drone.</t>
 <t id="11415">(ship/station)People are being taken out!</t>
 <t id="11416">(ship/station)This is hard to watch.</t>
 <t id="11420">(capship/station)I'm reading something big going critical!</t>
 <t id="11421">(capship/station)I don't think we can help them. It's too late.</t>
 <t id="11425">(station)A station has been lost!</t>
 <t id="11426">(station)Damn it! The station's not going to make it.</t>
 <t id="11450">We 'could' take this one in.('could' is to be spoken in a way where it is clear that it's but a remote possibility and that the comment itself does not express the speaker's desire to actually pick up the escape pod.)</t>
 <t id="11451">(Escape pod nearby)We could give this one a ride.</t>
 <t id="11455">(ship/station)Looks like their luck ran out.</t>
 <t id="11456">(ship/station)Their forces are taking heavy losses.</t>
 <t id="11460">(capship/station)Heavy damage has been dealt to that one!</t>
 <t id="11461">(capship/station)Something big just got tagged!</t>
 <t id="11465">(station)A station's been taken out!</t>
 <t id="11466">(station)That station's taken massive damage!</t>
 <t id="11500">Don't dry our capacitors!</t>
 <t id="11501">You heard her. Watch our energy level!</t>
 <t id="11502">We should buy better generators, energy is low again!</t>
 <t id="11503">(gun cooling)We need to give the guns time to cool.</t>
 <t id="11504">(gun cooling)They're inactive until they cool down.</t>
 <t id="11507">(general overheat)Temperature warning!</t>
 <t id="11508">(general overheat)Systems are running hot.</t>
 <t id="11509">(general cooling)It needs time to cool off.</t>
 <t id="11510">Do you have nothing to do?</t>
 <t id="11511">Shooting empty space is fun, right!</t>
 <t id="11512">Interesting hobby. Waste energy.</t>
 <t id="11520">Make each shot count!</t>
 <t id="11521">Land some good hits!</t>
 <t id="11522">We can't maintain fire for too long.</t>
 <t id="11530">Nice aiming, but save energy for another volley.</t>
 <t id="11531">Woah, cool down hotshot.</t>
 <t id="11532">Not a bad shot. You want a cookie? Just don't drain the capacitors!</t>
 <t id="11540">(Pick up power-up / ammo)Nice catch!</t>
 <t id="11541">(Pick up power-up / ammo)That's ours now.</t>
 <t id="11542">(Pick up power-up / ammo)Reeling in.</t>
 <t id="11543">There goes our snack budget.</t>
 <t id="11544">Ammo doesn't grow on trees! Not like there are trees up here.</t>
 <t id="11550">Make them count!</t>
 <t id="11560">Bad timing.</t>
 <t id="11561">Time to do this the old fashioned way!</t>
 <t id="11562">Alright flyboy. Use the guns!</t>
 <t id="11600">(primary weapon ready)All warmed up and ready to go.</t>
 <t id="11601">Locked and ready!</t>
 <t id="11602">Let's deal some damage!</t>
 <t id="11603">No-one better mess with us!</t>
 <t id="11610">(secondary ready)Missile loaded.</t>
 <t id="11615">(impulse emitter)Don't underestimate this little thing. It may not be the most powerful but it's perfect in a dogfight.</t>
 <t id="11620">(plasma emitter)That stuff is hot! If you see this stuff coming your way, you'd better have good shielding.</t>
 <t id="11625">(shotgun)This thing is great for taking down tiny and agile drones. In your case, maybe it just makes up for your aiming.</t>
 <t id="11626">I named the shotgun after the computer. Bruce, right?</t>
 <t id="11630">(mg)Rumour has it when fired in atmosphere, the bullets are so fast that they burst into flames!</t>
 <t id="11631">Ready to spit out fire!</t>
 <t id="11635">(beam)This thing may not be the best in combat but against an asteroid, boom!</t>
 <t id="11640">(dumbfire missile)I once knew a guy who could hit a drone 5 klicks away with these things. You'll probably want to point them at something bigger...and slower.</t>
 <t id="11645">(guided missile)These babies will track their target like a Spacefly possessed!</t>
 <t id="11646">Guidance online.</t>
 <t id="11650">(swarm missile)This swarm will blot out the sun...or whatever bright celestial object is nearby, consuming our foes in fiery plasma!</t>
 <t id="11651">Swarm ready!</t>
 <t id="11655">(torpedo)The combination of expert design and technical precision will result in a truly incredible hole in someone's hull. Hopefully never ours.</t>
 <t id="11656">Big bada boom!</t>
 <t id="11700">Yeah, you'd better stop that.</t>
 <t id="11701">Better not tick off the locals!</t>
 <t id="11702">They'll unfriend us!</t>
 <t id="11705">You should listen to her, this time.</t>
 <t id="11710">Nice hit!</t>
 <t id="11711">Keep it in your sights!</t>
 <t id="11712">Teach them to not mess with us!</t>
 <t id="11713">We come in peace!</t>
 <t id="11720">Boom!</t>
 <t id="11721">Worth it!</t>
 <t id="11730">What a waste.</t>
 <t id="11731">That one's not coming back.</t>
 <t id="11740">Turn it into scrap!</t>
 <t id="11741">Shred it!</t>
 <t id="11745">They'd better bail!</t>
 <t id="11746">They chose the wrong side!</t>
 <t id="11747">Maybe we should ask them to surrender.</t>
 <t id="11750">Sometimes the small things lead to huge explosions!</t>
 <t id="11755">You think we can take on something this big?</t>
 <t id="11756">If you're serious on fighting this thing, fly smart and pick your targets.</t>
 <t id="11757">I can't wait for the big explosion!</t>
 <t id="11800">Nice shot, for you.</t>
 <t id="11801">Scratch one!</t>
 <t id="11802">That's a kill!</t>
 <t id="11803">Chalk it up!</t>
 <t id="11804">Too easy!</t>
 <t id="11805">You're getting better at this.</t>
 <t id="11810">That little guy didn't stand a chance!</t>
 <t id="11811">Awww. Poor little thing.</t>
 <t id="11812">Big explosion for a drone!</t>
 <t id="11815">They picked the wrong day to be against us.</t>
 <t id="11816">Keep an eye out for their friends.</t>
 <t id="11820">Yeah! Soften them up!</t>
 <t id="11821">Every little helps.</t>
 <t id="11825">That'll slow them down!</t>
 <t id="11826">They're not going anywhere!</t>
 <t id="11830">Woah! Can't believe we pulled that off!</t>
 <t id="11831">Big boom incoming!</t>
 <t id="11832">Yes, we, did!</t>
 <t id="11833">I told you we'd do it!</t>
 <t id="11834">You're all fired!(laughing)</t>
 <t id="11835">The shadow of death lies around this colossus. Sad to see it go, but we had to...</t>
 <t id="11840">You nuts?</t>
 <t id="11841">Check your fire, damn it!</t>
 <t id="11850">Alright! They're backing off!</t>
 <t id="11855">I think we've lost them.</t>
 <t id="11860">Yeah! I knew we could do it!</t>
 <t id="11900">If we're to make it out here, we need friends!</t>
 <t id="11901">Don't think they're going to forgive that in a hurry</t>
 <t id="11902">Who needs friends when they can have enemies?</t>
 <t id="11910">See, making friends is easy enough.</t>
 <t id="11911">Look at you, making friends in high places!</t>
 <t id="11912">Think they owe us a favour now?</t>
 <t id="11920">Looks like we can count on these guys from now on.</t>
 <t id="11921">We're practically family!</t>
 <t id="11930">There go our parking privileges.</t>
 <t id="11931">I don't think we're invited to the next picnic.</t>
 <t id="11940">Didn't seem to like that... eh, they'll get over it.</t>
 <t id="11941">Maybe we should give them some time to calm down</t>
 <t id="11950">I think we can show our faces there again.</t>
 <t id="11951">They should have cooled off enough by now.</t>
 <t id="11960">(Reaching very good reputation)Looking forward to meeting lots of new friends.(happy)</t>
 <t id="11961">(Reaching very low reputation)They must hate our guts now. Good.(with a smirk)</t>
 <t id="11962">(Comment on lost licence)Oh dear, it looks like they don't like us any more.</t>
 <t id="11963">(Comment on lost licence)Oh well! Nothing lasts forever, I guess.</t>

 <t id="12005">Displaying the reference material.</t>
 <t id="12006">There's an info-vid on that, give me a moment.</t>
 <t id="12007">Looks like the database has details on that.</t>
 <t id="12008">We're receiving data.</t>
 <t id="12009">Receiving data-burst.</t>
 <t id="12010">This sounds cool, can we get one for the Skunk?</t>
 <t id="12011">Ugh, who needs a history lesson every time they open that damned thing.</t>
 <t id="12012">Why are you looking at that? It's illegal around here.</t>
 <t id="12013">This info has nothing to do with reality, you know what I mean?</t>
 <t id="12020">Shall I bring up the info we have on that?</t>
 <t id="12021">Need the info on that?</t>
 <t id="12022">Want to have a look?</t>
 <t id="12030">I've got no info on that.</t>
 <t id="12031">We need to update our database.</t>
 <t id="12040">(encyclopedia broken)Again? When do we get some spare parts for that piece of junk.</t>
 <t id="12041">Wait a moment, I will try to reconstruct the data. No, it's gone.</t>
 <t id="12042">Always good news from Betty, eh?</t>
 <t id="12100">I've got no info on that.</t>
 <t id="12101">Always a demand for that stuff.</t>
 <t id="12105">(Energy Cells)There's never enough energy.</t>
 <t id="12110">(Ore)Working in the ore mines isn't as much fun as it sounds.</t>
 <t id="12115">(Silicon)You know, silicon is so versatile it's used for much more than computers and tech goods.</t>
 <t id="12120">(Crystals)Seems a waste to use these in production when I'd appreciate them so much more.</t>
 <t id="12125">(Meatsteak)Have you ever taken a look at where they make that stuff. I'm sure that it breaks a dozen Argon Federation regulations, but boy, does it taste good!</t>
 <t id="12130">(Antimatter Cells)I've seen where Plutarch 'employees' work with Antimatter. I'm surprised there's not been a major accident which has taken out half the system.</t>
 <t id="12135">I still find it strange how we take the most common element in the universe, pack it up and slap a price tag on it.</t>
 <t id="12140">Don't you hate how every device has its own adapter?</t>
 <t id="12141">I heard from a friend once that they are using illegal antibiotics in the bio-optic wiring nowadays.</t>
 <t id="12145">I wouldn't be surprised if they purposefully reduce the efficiency of these cells so you have to buy more. That's what I would do...if I was a Teladi mogul.</t>
 <t id="12150">I think they shouldn't charge you for ion particles. Get it? 'Charge' you.</t>
 <t id="12155">While they say 'luxury', you still know the CEO isn't eating that stuff.</t>
 <t id="12156">I can't afford luxury rations with what you pay me. But next week is my birthday, did you know?</t>
 <t id="12160">Those chips these days are so small that you can drop them and lose them forever.</t>
 <t id="12165">That's some rare stuff. Good luck finding any in Albion!</t>
 <t id="12170">OK, forget crystals! This is what I want!</t>
 <t id="12171">Nividium cubes are a girl's best friend.</t>
 <t id="12175">Best be careful handling that stuff. Last thing you want is a plasma leak melting your cargo hold.</t>
 <t id="12180">(Plasma Cells)Those thing are packed with power!</t>
 <t id="12185">I bet I could make a better one of those.</t>
 <t id="12190">(Fuel)I love the smell of that fuel.</t>
 <t id="12195">(Snails)Those things have beautiful shells; I hear they taste...interesting.</t>
 <t id="12200">(Hull Plates)It's important to have high quality plates between you and weapons-fire.</t>
 <t id="12205">(Ad Sign)Ugh, ads everywhere. Want to get some target practice?</t>
 <t id="12210">(Medical Wares)There are some industries which always will make money. Everybody will always need a doctor someday. And after receiving the bill, a lawyer.</t>
 <t id="12215">(Narcotics)You know; I really feel like blowing up some pirate ships right now.</t>
 <t id="12220">(Quantum Tubes)I could explain how these work...but I'd end up putting us both to sleep.</t>
 <t id="12221">Kullgard's Quantum Tubes! Tech of this quality was long overdue.</t>
 <t id="12225">(Shipyard)I've always had a dream of owning a shipyard. At least I feel like I'm going in the right direction.</t>
 <t id="12230">(Space Fuel)That's the good stuff, even if it is in a legal grey area.</t>
 <t id="12235">(Space Weed)Back in the old days, this was one of the biggest Teladi exports. Policing it must have been a nightmare.</t>
 <t id="12240">(Spices)We should check our spice reserves in the kitchen.</t>
 <t id="12245">(Water)You should use it sometime.(laughs)</t>
 <t id="12246">One of these days, I'd love to see some rain. It sounds more fun than sucking it out of asteroids.</t>
 <t id="12250">(Wheat)Unbelievable how much wheat and water you have to put into an argnu to get one steak.</t>
 <t id="12255">(Chemical Compounds)Until they come up with a way to turn Ore into Nividium, I'm happy to avoid chemistry.</t>
 <t id="12260">(Warheads).</t>
 <t id="12265">(Ice)</t>
 <t id="12500">Should we wave?</t>
 <t id="12501">Let's say hello.</t>
 <t id="12502">Hope they don't mind us staring.</t>
 <t id="12505">Don't get too close to those. They'll burn us to a crisp.</t>
 <t id="12506">So hot!</t>
 <t id="12507">Wanna guess how much thrust those things have?</t>
 <t id="12510">Engines are as cold as space.</t>
 <t id="12511">Looks like they're holding position.</t>
 <t id="12515">Those engines aren't going anywhere fast.</t>
 <t id="12520">It'll take some firepower to get through that!</t>
 <t id="12521">When you tickle it, it shows its friends.</t>
 <t id="12525">Won't take much more to expose the hull.</t>
 <t id="12526">Its integrity is failing.</t>
 <t id="12530">The pinnacle of Terran engineering, with an Argon twist of course.</t>
 <t id="12531">Those things save so much travel time.</t>
 <t id="12535">Don't provoke them!</t>
 <t id="12536">Those things, not so nice when aimed at you.</t>
 <t id="12537">That's quite some firepower.</t>
 <t id="12540">If you'd ever want to disable the flak, this is where to strike.</t>
 <t id="12545">Those things pack a punch!</t>
 <t id="12550">Prepared to bring us down if you want to land.</t>
 <t id="12551">You want to set down for a bit?</t>
 <t id="12555">Best keep clear of the docking lane.</t>
 <t id="12560">Don't get too close or the next drone could slam into us.</t>
 <t id="12561">I used to just sit and watch drones swarm out of these things.</t>
 <t id="12562">Drones swarming out of those things remind me of Spaceflies from an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="12565">That has 'blow me up' written all over it!</t>
 <t id="12566">Don't get too close to those things.</t>
 <t id="12570">They're so small.</t>
 <t id="12571">Look at that tiny thing.</t>
 <t id="12575">That's the best size for a ship right there. Not much bigger than a cargo container but enough to pack a punch.</t>
 <t id="12580">That thing's built like a tank!</t>
 <t id="12585">Now that's a ship!</t>
 <t id="12586">That ship's a big deal!</t>
 <t id="12590">Always serving and protecting, when it suits them.</t>
 <t id="12591">Best not get too close.</t>
 <t id="12595">I wonder if they've got any medicinals for sale.</t>
 <t id="12596">I've worked on some of those ships. Can get crazy fast!</t>
 <t id="12600">Nothing but empty promises.</t>
 <t id="12601">Next time we dock, I'll slap some advertisements on the hull? That was a joke...</t>
 <t id="12605">Ugh, I hate flying on those things. Smells like rotten Cahoonas.</t>
 <t id="12610">What do you get when you blow up a liquid transporter? Splash Damage! (pause)Fine, you come up with one!</t>
 <t id="12615">These things always manage to get in your way, especially when they try to race each other.</t>
 <t id="12616">If we were the plundering type, that thing would be ripe for the picking.</t>
 <t id="12620">I once sabotaged a fleet of Plutarch drones so they welded each other together. A big wrecking ball of welding destruction is the last thing you want to see on a construction site.</t>
 <t id="12625">They're packed in there like a Boron in a can.</t>
 <t id="12626">I don't see why they'd buy something without big guns!</t>
 <t id="12630">Just thinking of the things that drone could do to Plutarch! I'd love to have a fleet of them.</t>
 <t id="12631">Those things swarming is one hell of a sight.</t>
 <t id="12635">Full of some brave souls.</t>
 <t id="12636">With a good team, those things can cut through hull in seconds!</t>
 <t id="12640">So much destruction here.</t>
 <t id="12641">I wonder how many people were on that thing.</t>
 <t id="12645">Thinking of pulling off an old fashioned train heist?</t>
 <t id="12646">Want to race the train?</t>
 <t id="12650">Want to race the elevator?</t>
 <t id="12651">You'll give them a fright if you get too close!</t>
 <t id="13000">(Hazardous Area)You see that, right?!</t>
 <t id="13001">Do you really want a closer look?</t>
 <t id="13002">Oh sure, this is a great idea.</t>
 <t id="13010">(Hazardous Area)Are you crazy?!</t>
 <t id="13011">We can't stay here!</t>
 <t id="13012">Get us out of here!</t>
 <t id="13013">This was a terrible idea!</t>
 <t id="13020">(Low Visibility Area)Close to flying blind.</t>
 <t id="13021">Not a bad place for an ambush.</t>
 <t id="13025">(Policed Area)Fly casual, you're being watched</t>
 <t id="13026">Careful, you've got eyes on you</t>
 <t id="13030">(Toxic area)We're gonna need a good decontamination after this.</t>
 <t id="13031">Pretty sure flying through this stuff violates some health regulations.</t>
 <t id="13040">(Asteroids. No Scanner)Once we install a scanner, we should come back here.</t>
 <t id="13045">(Unknown Ast.)Would be good to scan the area for asteroid yields.</t>
 <t id="13046">Maybe these asteroids contain something worthwhile.</t>
 <t id="13047">Want to go treasure-hunting in these asteroids?</t>
 <t id="13050">(Low Ast.)Nothing but worthless rocks around here.</t>
 <t id="13051">Doubt you'll find much worth mining here.</t>
 <t id="13052">These rocks aren't even worth the energy to shoot.</t>
 <t id="13053">You can use these as target practice. Not much else.</t>
 <t id="13055">(High Ast.)Woah! We're in the credits here!</t>
 <t id="13056">We make it rich off of these!</t>
 <t id="13057">I'd dig with my bare hands for those minerals!</t>
 <t id="13060">(Wrecks)Analysing debris in the area. Most have evidence of weapons damage.</t>
 <t id="13061">Running into wrecks is never a good omen.</t>
 <t id="13070">(Relative Movement)Attempting to match movement with thrusters.</t>
 <t id="13071">They're trying to shake us but I think we've got them.</t>
 <t id="13072">Disengaging relative movement aids.</t>
 <t id="13080">(empty area)There's really not much going on out here.</t>
 <t id="13081">What are we doing here?</t>
 <t id="13090">(Nice view)Check out that view.</t>

 <t id="101033">We're you expecting company? Are these drones yours?</t>
 <t id="101034">Looks like drones from the Sovereign Syndicate(see 20203,2401). Do you ever have a quiet day?</t>
 <t id="101035">You should move the ship. A boarding party may be on the way.</t>
 <t id="101036">We should check the nearby stations. There are usually pretty capable freelance captains ready to take charge of a ship.</t>
 <t id="101037">Not specifically but I think I can point you in the right direction.</t>
 <t id="101038">If you want you could also find an engineer or a defence officer. They'll improve the capabilities of your ship.</t>
 <t id="101039">We should find an engineer. They'll take care of repairing any damaged components, which is pretty useful after a fight.</t>
 <t id="101040">You may want to consider finding a defence officer. They help in the defence of their ship or station, coordinating the turrets and drones.</t>
 <t id="101041">Looks like the ship is ready to go.</t>
 <t id="101042">You should add the ship to your squad.</t>
 <t id="101043">Once in your squad, the ship will follow you.</t>
 <t id="101044">Don't worry about the following ship. I'm sure they'll keep up with their engines and Jump Drive.</t>
 <t id="101045">How about we try and recoup our investment in the captain by having the ship do some trade runs?</t>
 <t id="101046">Looks like those pirates want to know what happened to their drones.</t>
 <t id="101047">You'd better defend yourself.</t>
 <t id="101048">It's intact but deactivated. May be risky.</t>
 <t id="101049">Missile system activated.</t>
 <t id="101050">They're running.</t>
 <t id="101051">How about improving the Skunk's armaments?</t>
 <t id="101052">Guns are one thing, drones are another.</t>
 <t id="101053">Exactly. You can take the fight to them from afar or use a hacker drone to uncover useful intel on stations.</t>
 <t id="101054">Suit yourself. You'd be missing out on all the gossip.</t>
 <t id="101055">You can find drones for sale on some platforms.</t>
 <t id="101056">The drone's secured in the dock. How about you give it a test-drive.</t>
 <t id="101057">(#laugh#)These things are great for annoying people from a distance.</t>
 <t id="101058">(#shrug01#)Sounds like you want bigger guns.</t>
 <t id="101059">(#punchhand01#)I've got just the idea. There's a Heart of Albion station with a cache of old Argon Federation weapons.</t>
 <t id="101060">(#thinking01#)I know for a fact that they've been suffering power shortages for the last month.</t>
 <t id="101061">A delivery of Energy Cells could make us a little profit and allow them to part with a set of old plasma weapons.</t>
 <t id="101062">I know for a fact that they're short of a few supplies.</t>
 <t id="101063">A visit from the freighter could make us a little profit and allow them to part with a set of old plasma weapons.</t>
 <t id="101064">If you want, you can fly around the station and see if you can find anything to give us leverage for a discount or commission.</t>
 <t id="101065">Let me contact the station and see if we can get a meeting for the weapons.</t>
 <t id="101066">All right, bring her into dock.</t>
 <t id="101067">You know I can hear you, right?</t>
 <t id="101068">If you want to give these babies a try, we should look for some asteroids.</t>
 <t id="101069">(disappointed)Aww. And we were just about to have fun with guns.</t>
 <t id="101070">Well Otani, it's been fun.</t>
 <t id="101071">Sorry Otani. After you've known me for a few hours the odds are you're already on their most wanted list.</t>
 <t id="101072">That was a joke.</t>
 <t id="101073">Ren, I'm not liking how some of these Plutarch ships are behaving.</t>
 <t id="101074">They're watching us. Maybe we should speed it up a bit.</t>
 <t id="101075">No sign of Borman yet.</t>
 <t id="101076">(curious)What is going on here?</t>
 <t id="101077">Is...is the Jump Gate open?</t>
 <t id="101078">We've lost the signal. I don't like this.</t>
 <t id="101079">Sorry Ren, we've got to ditch them.</t>
 <t id="101080">The Skunk's picked up a bit of damage. We should get that looked into.</t>
 <t id="101081">There's a highway crossing in the next zone.</t>
 <t id="101082">Get ready to leave this highway in a moment.</t>
 <t id="101083">We should fly over to the other highway now.</t>
 <t id="101084">That's Borman's ship over there. They'll be expecting us.</t>
 <t id="101085">That's the Badlands Colony(see 20103,101) up ahead. It's not exactly a model of comfort but it's welcoming enough.</t>
 <t id="101086">Looks like the Sovereign Syndicate(see 20203,2401) is causing trouble.</t>
 <t id="101087">Looks like someone's causing trouble.</t>
 <t id="101088">We'd best keep our distance. Take a look at the map to check where they're heading.</t>
 <t id="101089">Looks like they've been taken down.</t>
 <t id="101090">Wow! I'm surprised you were able to pull that off.</t>
 <t id="101091">Look, just get me to the Badlands Colony(see 20103,101). I have a contact there who can fix up your ship.</t>
 <t id="101092">This is the wrong dock.</t>
 <t id="101093">Looks like the database is missing info on local objects.</t>
 <t id="101094">You should be able to gather information on objects like stations when you pass nearby.</t>
 <t id="101095">Try on that station.</t>
 <t id="101096">The computer can store information on this zone as well as trade offers on stations.</t>
 <t id="101097">There are sometimes opportunities to find discounts which can pay off later.</t>
 <t id="101098">I've heard that this sector has quite a lot of wreckage and crates drifting out there.</t>
 <t id="101099">Have you used the Long Range Scan Mode?(see 30408,101)</t>
 <t id="101100">That mode can help you find small objects at a distance.</t>
 <t id="101101">While we wait, how about checking if there are any local jobs available?</t>
 <t id="101102">I've marked one which shouldn't take long.</t>
 <t id="101103">I suggest you take a look at the briefing. I don't think the ship's ready for sector patrols yet.</t>
 <t id="101104">Take a look at your Mission Manager if you want more info or to switch your current mission.</t>
 <t id="101105">You can abort the mission at any time.</t>
 <t id="101106">Some won't appreciate half a job though.</t>
 <t id="101107">(#rolleyes01#)Wow! That certainly isn't cheap.</t>
 <t id="101108">How about we look around?</t>
 <t id="101109">Paying close attention to stations may yield better deals with discounts or commissions.</t>
 <t id="101110">I once identified a coolant leak in a storage area. (#smile#)To shut me up they gave me a 50% discount on their frozen goods.</t>
 <t id="101111">(#laugh#)It's surprising how well coolant goes with ice cream.</t>
 <t id="101112">Looks like there was a container embedded in there.</t>
 <t id="101113">It's small enough to be collected.</t>
 <t id="101114">Let's check it out.</t>
 <t id="101115">From personal experience, I have to say being shot at in a highway is one of the worst ways to travel.</t>
 <t id="101116">They say the Smokestack Bandit(see 20005,3) attacked over 30 ships before he was caught.</t>
 <t id="101117">Most of them just dropped their cargo. Unfortunately there were a few who weren't so smart.</t>
 <t id="101118">There are more details in your Mission Manager.</t>
 <t id="101119">From there you can see your current objectives.</t>
 <t id="101120">I guess before I go I can impart some of my vast knowledge to you.</t>
 <t id="101121">And another thing.</t>
 <t id="101122">Let's get trading.</t>
 <t id="101123">Let's get started.</t>
 <t id="101124">Best check that the weapons work.</t>
 <t id="101125">You should dock and look for a Captain.</t>
 <t id="101126">Don't be shy. Try speaking to someone.</t>
 <t id="101127">Don't believe everything they say, especially if it's about how qualified they are.</t>
 <t id="101128">If I'm ever looking to hire someone or get a good deal, I usually try to sweet-talk them.</t>
 <t id="101129">Some parts of stations will require Scanner Drones to uncover information about them.</t>
 <t id="101130">Any information you've uncovered will be in the object's info menu.</t>
 <t id="101131">If you ever find yourself in a tough spot you can use the 'Smart Defence' ability to launch all offensive drones to help.</t>
 <t id="101132">This is a really versatile ship. I'd keep an eye out for more weapons for sale from mechanics.(see 20208,1101)</t>
 <t id="101133">We've only got a few missiles.</t>
 <t id="101134">These lock on to your target.</t>
 <t id="101135">Select one of the ships and blow them away!</t>
 <t id="101136">There's a crate in the wreckage.</t>
 <t id="101137">It could be missiles.</t>
 <t id="101138">It could be goodies.</t>
 <t id="101139">These are dumb-fire missiles. Not very good against fighters but great for damaging the surface of a capship.</t>
 <t id="101140">When you cycle through the missiles it'll take time for them to be ready.</t>
 <t id="101141">Keep an eye out for other missiles.</t>
 <t id="101142">Swarm missiles are great against drones and there are also torpedos you guide yourself!</t>
 <t id="101143">I'd love to try one out!</t>
 <t id="101144">Open the Ability Menu(see 1001,2667) to see the drones you have available.</t>
 <t id="101145">Most drones can be controlled remotely, but not all.</t>
 <t id="101146">Give it a try.</t>
 <t id="101147">Looking good.</t>
 <t id="101148">(Sarcastic)Great, now we have to buy another one.</t>
 <t id="101149">Some drones have abilities you can activate. They'll launch, do their thing, and hopefully make it back safely.</t>
 <t id="101150">It'll be faster to use the Mining Laser.(see 20105,601)</t>
 <t id="101151">It's a shame you don't have a capship with collector drones. The minerals in these rocks are used in many industries.</t>
 <t id="101152">If you want to collect the rocks, start the Asteroid Collecting Mode.(see 30403,101)</t>
 <t id="101153">You'll need a capship stocked with collector drones.</t>
 <t id="101154">Now just tag an asteroid and a drone will be sent to collect it.</t>
 <t id="101155">While you're out there, watch out for containers packed with goodies.</t>
 <t id="101156">If it's not locked or nailed down, grab it.</t>
 <t id="101157">If you don't mind getting dirty, take a look in the vents too.</t>
 <t id="101158">(alarmed)Plutarch has marked us as criminals. The IFF reads enemy.</t>
 <t id="101159">You should warn your crews.</t>
 <t id="102000">(Not Spoken)Chapter 2 lines</t>
 <t id="102001">(first time using a jumpgate)Wow! (#smile#)That'll take some getting used to.</t>
 <t id="102002">It was either that or get arrested. (#shrug01#)At least out here we can gain some distance.</t>
 <t id="102003">(#sad#)They'll probably shoot anything emerging from the gate before asking questions. And they're probably after you too now.</t>
 <t id="102004">This system isn't in the database. I'm seeing highways and debris but no activity.</t>
 <t id="102005">Right, it should have connected to the Belt of Aguilar system. This isn't it.</t>
 <t id="102006">They're not responding. Hopefully they'll be focussing on the gate so much they'll forget all about us. Not to mention it gives us the chance to be the first to explore this system.</t>
 <t id="102007">It looks like this will take us deeper into the system. Maybe there are people closer to the sun.</t>
 <t id="102008">Look! More rocks!</t>
 <t id="102009">There was a mining operation here at some point. I wonder when it was abandoned.</t>
 <t id="102010">I'm picking up ships nearby, heading this way. I don't know who they are.</t>
 <t id="102011">They don't look too friendly.</t>
 <t id="102012">This is the Albion Skunk. Identify youself!</t>
 <t id="102013">Looks like they're not afraid of Skunks. You are going to shoot them right?</t>
 <t id="102018">Woah, don't just sit there! Get us out of here!</t>
 <t id="102019">That station looks active. Do you think we should take a closer look?</t>
 <t id="102020">I don't like the look of that station. I say we keep clear.</t>
 <t id="102021">Someone out there is transmitting. Patching it through.</t>
 <t id="102022">Not easily. He's making it hard to get a position, probably so only his people can find him. He's near though.</t>
 <t id="102023">There's a highway up ahead out of this place.</t>
 <t id="102024">Maybe that ship was heading this way.</t>
 <t id="102025">They could still need our help. They can't have been far.</t>
 <t id="102026">(anything look familiar?)Nothing which reminds me of anything in Albion. I wonder if these people were trapped in their system as long as we were.</t>
 <t id="102027">Woah! Take a look at that station.</t>
 <t id="102028">That must be the home station that guy was talking about.</t>
 <t id="102029">It looks operational.</t>
 <t id="102030">Let's hope they're friendlier than those other guys.</t>
 <t id="102031">This is the Albion Skunk. We're not looking for trouble.</t>
 <t id="102032">(#smile#)That's because we're not. We're from the Albion system. Our Jump Gate reopened and connected here.</t>
 <t id="102033">I can speak for my people, Heart of Albion. (#warm#)We're always open for trade and building relations. (#hard#)Unfortunately, I expect the Plutarch government will make it very difficult for that to happen.</t>
 <t id="102034">(#smile#)That's fine by me, I'm sure they deserved it. In all seriousness, the situation in Albion is complicated. (#disapproval01#)Plutarch is much more than a mining corporation now.</t>
 <t id="102035">You should be worried about Plutarch extending their influence. (#cold#)They've already blockaded the gate, it won't be long until they start sending ships around the system.</t>
 <t id="102036">Did we just make first contact? Bit anti-climactic don't you think? I expected an interrogation.</t>
 <t id="102037">Maybe this Karen Stringer is a hard-ass cop and she's gonna beat info out of us.</t>
 <t id="102038">It's just not what I expected. It's got me on edge.</t>
 <t id="102039">Ren, those are Terran ships!</t>
 <t id="102040">Positive. I remember seeing them in footage of the Terran Conflict.</t>
 <t id="102041">If they are Terran, I hope they don't hold grudges. We're not in any state to get into a war.</t>
 <t id="102042">I'll disable the alert. We're on edge as it is.</t>
 <t id="102043">Looks like those Reivers are making a run on the station.</t>
 <t id="102044">If we're going to stay here, I think so. How about we rough them up a little.</t>
 <t id="102045">Looks like the station's being damaged!</t>
 <t id="102046">The new shield is installed. Maybe it'll keep us alive long enough to slip past.</t>
 <t id="102050">We saw the explosion! Is there anything we can help with?</t>
 <t id="102051">(#sad#)Have you always been fighting?</t>
 <t id="102052">Hey, watch out who you call aliens. (#warm#)Don't forget us Argon came from Earth too. Doesn't the fact that we're technically at war not bother you?</t>
 <t id="102053">(excited)Are you kidding! I'd love to get my hands on one.</t>
 <t id="102054">And...install it on your ship as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="102055">Don't you have a defence force?</t>
 <t id="102056">We could just check out the area. Maybe the Reivers are causing them problems.</t>
 <t id="102057">I say we go get our stuff back! I'm not up for a suicide mission though.</t>
 <t id="102058">It'll be tough but we could try and get our ships through the gate.</t>
 <t id="102059">With our ships and contacts, we could really make a difference here.</t>
 <t id="102060">There aren't too many Plutarch ships there, and it looks like they get drawn away from the gate by the Reivers. I think we should slip past.</t>
 <t id="102061">Maybe, but we'd just need to make it to a highway. Our new shields should be able to cover us for long enough.</t>
 <t id="102062">Here's our chance!</t>
 <t id="102063">Well, that was easy enough.</t>
 <t id="102064">I hope Falk has started causing some trouble. I'm marking a typical Heart of Albion rendezvous location, we should get a move on.</t>
 <t id="102065">Give them time. We have people monitoring these locations. They'll contact us soon enough.</t>
 <t id="102066">We were forced to go through the gate. We've made a few friends and enemies over there but we're alright.</t>
 <t id="102067">Do you mean it's started?</t>
 <t id="102068">Please Ren. We've been planning years for this. We have thousands of people behind us. You can help them.</t>
 <t id="102069">We can do that. You up for that Ren?</t>
 <t id="102070">I'd love to see the CEO's face when this goes live.</t>
 <t id="102071">Looks like Plutarch has already started trying to purge the system. Hopefully enough people saw it to go viral.</t>
 <t id="102072">Yeah! It'll take them weeks to purge their systems. Job done, let's get out of here!</t>
 <t id="102073">We could offer them an alliance. We can't let Plutarch gain a permanent foothold in DeVries. If we help the Canterans, rebuild their infrastructure, we could use their space as a staging area for our operations.</t>
 <t id="102074">He'll warm up to the idea. He's been planning this for a long time but I don't think he ever expected friendly Terrans to be on the other side of the gate asking for help.</t>
 <t id="102075">Nothing stopping us doing both. I say we investigate what happened to our ships and then gather some supplies for Nakano. I've a contact here that can give us the latest info and help set us up.</t>
 <t id="102076">This is Yisha Tarren of Heart of Albion on board the Albion Skunk. I'm hoping to speak with Yoolis.(pronounced Yo-olis)</t>
 <t id="102077">Yeah, we've had some dealings. Usually it was me passing on intel and her helping me get out of sticky situations. You know her?</t>
 <t id="102078">And now you've met me, Borman and hopefully now Yoolis. Your life must have been pretty boring before I came along.</t>
 <t id="102079">And you Yoolis.</t>
 <t id="102080">Yoolis, we're trying to track down some of our stuff, our people. Can you help us out?</t>
 <t id="102081">I'm sure Plutarch are rounding up all Heart of Albion sympathisers they find. Maybe Falk's interested in a prison break.</t>
 <t id="102096">More Reivers? This place is like a war zone!</t>
 <t id="102097">We're receiving the Reiver threat data-burst. You know we could lend a hand. Make some more friends; earn a few rewards.</t>
 <t id="102098">Think of all the Terran tech we can get our hands on. These new shields could just be the start!</t>
 <t id="102099">We've got an incoming hail from Nakano. Maybe we've earned a reward. I hope it's guns!</t>
 <t id="102100">We'll keep our distance, but what are you going to do about it?</t>
 <t id="102101">We may just do that. Good luck with your operation.</t>
 <t id="102102">I've got the rearguard group's position. I say we back them up. With all this Reiver pressure, they must be close to breaking-point.</t>
 <t id="102103">There's too many coming through!</t>
 <t id="102104">We're taking losses!</t>
 <t id="102105">No, but I expect she's somewhere near the Jump Gate, just waiting for an opportunity to profit.</t>
 <t id="102106">We could blindly fly around or we could get our hands dirty, hacking into station nav records to find them. Either way, I'm feeling lucky.</t>
 <t id="102107">Reliable intel is hard to come by these days. We'll have to fly around and keep our eyes peeled.</t>
 <t id="102108">According to this, their ship passed through here several hours ago.</t>
 <t id="102109">They docked here for a while. I think I can get some info about their flight plan.</t>
 <t id="102110">Right. I think I've got a good idea where they are now.</t>
 <t id="102111">There they are!</t>
 <t id="102112">We need as much information as you can give us about this ship.</t>
 <t id="102113">Transfer complete, we've got it all. Prisoner manifests, ship specifications, escort complement. Everything we need for a bust-out.</t>
 <t id="102114">I'm sorry, but did you just come up with an awesome idea? I'm all for it!</t>
 <t id="102115">I'll send a data-burst to Borman with our proposal. I'm sure he'll jump at the chance.</t>
 <t id="102116">Data-burst away. Hopefully he'll get back to us soon. We should make sure we're all ready for boarding operations.</t>
 <t id="102117">I think we're all set but I'll let you know if that changes.</t>
 <t id="102118">We could do with some more marines.</t>
 <t id="102119">We won't get far without a Marine Officer to plan the operation and lead the marines.</t>
 <t id="102120">Maybe we should stay in Albion, just in case Borman needs us.</t>
 <t id="102121">So, you think we can do it?</t>
 <t id="102122">The Skunk's all ready for a boarding operation. Just tell us what the game plan is.</t>
 <t id="102123">Let's go Ren!</t>
 <t id="102124">We have to dock at one of the ships. Try to choose one which won't explode.</t>
 <t id="102125">Ren, we're too late! Get us out of here before Plutarch comes down on us!</t>
 <t id="102126">It's smart. Plutarch didn't expect us to commit to a major battle. We'd better strike again before they regroup</t>
 <t id="102127">We don't have much firepower so nothing too big, not that we want to blow up every station we see.</t>
 <t id="102128">You're going after the ship impound area?</t>
 <t id="102129">But taking control of all those ships, that'll be a huge boarding operation. Not to mention taking out any patrolling ships in the way.</t>
 <t id="102130">Well, you're deep in the fight now Ren.</t>
 <t id="102131">We're about as ready as we're going to be. Let's get our stuff back.</t>
 <t id="102132">Woah, moderate resistance? - My cahoona!</t>
 <t id="102133">Marking the next boarding target.</t>
 <t id="102134">No more boarding for us. Let's disable a few Plutarch ships!</t>
 <t id="102135">There's nothing left to board. Let's protect the fleet until everyone's ready to bug out.</t>
 <t id="102136">Falk, I think we'd like to continue exploring relations with the Canteran people in DeVries. At least get them some of the supplies they've asked for.</t>
 <t id="102137">Right, I've put together a list of wares the Canterans may have use for. Nothing too valuable for this trial run. When we're ready, I'll try and contact Borman to see if he can help us get through the gate.</t>
 <t id="102138">When we're ready I can try to contact Borman; see if he can help us through the gate.</t>
 <t id="102139">I'll see if I can get Borman to commit a few ships for a diversion.</t>
 <t id="102140">I doubt he can turn down a fight with Plutarch.</t>
 <t id="102141">This is Tarren. We're going to attempt going through the gate. We could use a distraction for the Plutarch forces. Can you assist?</t>
 <t id="102142">I'm getting a transmission from Governor Nakano.</t>
 <t id="102143">Hello Governor.</t>
 <t id="102144">Not a problem, that's what allies do.</t>
 <t id="102145">Absolutely. We have similar problems on our end. How about we continue to help each other? That should make their decisions easier.</t>
 <t id="102146">Listen to this Ren. They say they need Refined Metal, lots of it. What if we don't deliver the stuff but actually refine it here. We can build a Metal Works.</t>
 <t id="102147">It'll be tough at the start, but once they start repairing stuff with the metal we provide, the whole economy should get better. Plus, it's a place of our own to fall back to.</t>
 <t id="102148">I don't have to mention the potential profits do I?</t>
 <t id="102149">Hope they don't mind us building here.</t>
 <t id="102150">Everything looks good. Now we need to get it operational and start churning out produce.</t>
 <t id="102151">I say we work on getting it productive before we move on. I'll set up a milestone we should reach.</t>
 <t id="102152">What's happened?</t>
 <t id="102153">You want to bring the refugees here?</t>
 <t id="102154">I expect they'll be willing to a point. They can't support many more people here and they have no interest in getting involved in our war.</t>
 <t id="102155">Right, this used to be a mining colony. Maybe if we help them get back to what they used to be, they'll look more kindly on our situation. Could you send some mining ships here, split the ore 50-50. They will get them on the right track.</t>
 <t id="102156">We'll get it done.</t>
 <t id="102157">And if I may ask, do you have any good news?</t>
 <t id="102158">Good to hear. We can use all the help we can get.</t>
 <t id="102159">Let's not waste time. Those people can't wait forever.</t>
 <t id="102160">I take it you've seen the new station.</t>
 <t id="102161">Glad to hear it. We actually have something else in mind to help around here. Captain Borman is willing to have a mining ship sent to some of the untapped asteroid fields. We were thinking of splitting the ore 50-50.</t>
 <t id="102162">That sounds great Governor.</t>
 <t id="102163">The situation in Albion is volatile, unpredictable. We may need a safe place for refugees at some point. We were hoping that you would provide sanctuary.</t>
 <t id="102164">Understood. So, do we have permission for our ship to jump in.</t>
 <t id="102165">Thank you Governor.</t>
 <t id="102166">Yeah. He either wants to keep a close eye on us or he really does want an alliance in the future.</t>
 <t id="102167">Careful Ren. Almost sounded like you don't.</t>
 <t id="102168">I've got the jump coordinates. I'll tell Borman to stand by.</t>
 <t id="102169">Right, she'll be here any moment.(she referring to a ship)</t>
 <t id="102170">There she is. Hailing.</t>
 <t id="102171">Thanks Captain. We've got some friends here to escort us on.</t>
 <t id="102172">Captain. You stay here with the Canteran mining ships. Mind your manners and play nice.</t>
 <t id="102173">That's enough Reivers to give us some trouble.</t>
 <t id="102174">There's that, or we can bring in the tank! Captain?</t>
 <t id="102175">Do it.</t>
 <t id="102176">There's a deactivated Jump Gate near here. Do you have anyone guarding that thing?</t>
 <t id="102177">I'm still hoping for Boron being on the other side.</t>
 <t id="102178">Affirmative. Looks like we're all ready. We'll do what we can to help.</t>
 <t id="102179">This is Yisha. How can we help?</t>
 <t id="102180">Can't you intercept them?</t>
 <t id="102181">How long do we have?</t>
 <t id="102182">Amber Excavator, prepare jump prep. Everyone else stick close and head for the highway out of here.</t>
 <t id="102183">No. The less Heart of Albion ships Plutarch finds here, the better.</t>
 <t id="102184">Contact. Plutarch scout. They've seen us too.</t>
 <t id="102185">I think they're drones, just sent to scout with no risk.</t>
 <t id="102186">I'm picking up a data-burst from the drones. We have to shut them down!</t>
 <t id="102187">(shouts)Ren! a Plutarch cap ship just jumped in!</t>
 <t id="102188">It's firing on the mining ships!</t>
 <t id="102189">We'll try and disable the engines and weapons. Try and draw their fire away from the miners!</t>
 <t id="102190">Captain, you can't help. Just get out of here!</t>
 <t id="102191">Nakano, we're losing people out here!</t>
 <t id="102192">We've lost Halifax!</t>
 <t id="102193">Scatter people! Make yourselves hard to chase.</t>
 <t id="102194">They're charging their Jump Drive. Should we let them go?</t>
 <t id="102195">We need to finish this! Now!</t>
 <t id="102196">They've jumped out. No contacts.</t>
 <t id="102197">(depressed)Not many. We need additional ships to search for survivors.</t>
 <t id="102198">We'll help in any way we can. Did you find any more survivors?</t>
 <t id="102199">We knew Plutarch was exploring DeVries. We only have limited information on their patrols.</t>
 <t id="102200">Borman is the one in charge and he sure as hell didn't want you attacked. I'm sure they're looking into why our ships were put in danger. We're not trying to bring you into the war, we're looking to you for sanctuary.</t>
 <t id="102201">So, we can bring of refugees here? But you want us to militarise your space?</t>
 <t id="102202">Maybe we can send some forces but we need most of them in Albion, keeping up pressure.</t>
 <t id="102203">I will. Thank you Nakano.</t>
 <t id="102204">(reserved)Huh, yeah, sure.</t>
 <t id="102205">Just a stupid thought. These guys are Terran. I hope that we don't turn on each other once this war is over.</t>
 <t id="102206">Heh, it's been a while since someone reminded me of the federation. Those must have been the good old days. Something to think about. Thanks Ren.</t>
 <t id="102207">I'll let Borman know that we plan on heading back. He can tell us if it's safe.</t>
 <t id="102208">Beryll's had a history of turning tides of war with their tech. The attack on the Earth Torus couldn't have happened without them.</t>
 <t id="102209">They've been pumping out drones since the war started. That's no secret.</t>
 <t id="102210">If it's enough to cause Beryll scientists to leave, it can't be good.</t>
 <t id="102211">I bet they'll just set up an encrypted transmission. These guys can hide pretty well when they want to.</t>
 <t id="102212">What the!? Tunnelling-scan signal. It's in our systems!</t>
 <t id="102213">What exactly is going on?</t>
 <t id="102214">(Surprised)That's it? Plutarch's already got thousands of drones. They may not be the smartest things in the world but they do their job.</t>
 <t id="102215">So, the question is, why did you leave? Isn't robotic warfare your speciality?</t>
 <t id="102216">I'll forward all of this to Borman. Once we get the all clear, we go.</t>
 <t id="102217">Getting Borman on the comm.</t>
 <t id="102218">(notices something strange)Err, Falk. These coordinates...</t>
 <t id="102219">(slightly worried)OK, here we are.</t>
 <t id="102220">Yes. Yes it was.</t>
 <t id="102221">Alright! Let's go!</t>
 <t id="102222">Take out those fighters!</t>
 <t id="102223">Some of those ships are going to jump to the civilian convoy. We can hitch a ride.</t>
 <t id="102224">The defence group's getting into position around the civilians. Not many Plutarch forces yet.</t>
 <t id="102225">Plutarch ships jumping in!</t>
 <t id="102226">Woah, new contacts. Unknown ship configurations. Those must be the unmanned Plutarch ships.</t>
 <t id="102227">There's a load of them! Let's get in there!</t>
 <t id="102228">Most ships are through the gate.</t>
 <t id="102229">Let's keep to the rear for now. That's where Plutarch will attack.</t>
 <t id="102230">We should move forward to the front of the group, just in case we run into Reivers.</t>
 <t id="102231">Friendly contacts! Canteran reinforcements!</t>
 <t id="102232">Where are our defence ships? The civilian ships are taking hits!</t>
 <t id="102233">I doubt we'll manage to get through the gate to Albion now, unless we run an assault with our fleet.</t>
 <t id="102234">Plutarch must be really desperate, turning to those drones. We've got them on the ropes, maybe we're going the wrong way.</t>
 <t id="102235">Incoming transmission.</t>
 <t id="102236">We won't be half-strength for long. The Canterans will patch us up and get into the fight themselves. And Borman knows what he's doing.</t>
 <t id="102237">Look's like I'm not the only one with second thoughts.</t>
 <t id="102238">Why do people keep saying that to us?</t>
 <t id="102239">Thank you. I'll have our captains coordinate with your people. Many of the freighters are fully stocked with supplies.</t>
 <t id="102240">Well, technically, there are several other people in the fleet ranked higher than me. We don't have much of a chain of command though.</t>
 <t id="102241">Us too. Alright Governor, I accept. Let me know what you need me to do.</t>
 <t id="102242">Well, that's one for the history books. Me solidifying an alliance between Argon and Terrans. We've done good.</t>
 <t id="102243">(sigh)Enough excitement for one day.</t>
 <t id="102244">Let's check on our stuff. Make sure things are in working order for the days ahead.</t>
 <t id="102245">(Speech)A lot has changed in the decades past. We found ourselves isolated and alone. Perhaps everyone we once knew are doing the same, fighting for survival in this lonely universe. But now, it seems this time is ending as we have finally found people we can call friends.</t>
 <t id="102246">We can look forward to an era of cooperation, advancement and peace. But first we must secure them against those who used our isolation to oppress our people and stagnate our culture.</t>
 <t id="102247">Together, we can protect our peoples from these threats. Together, we can secure DeVries and retake Albion. But we must first end a dark chapter in our history so that we can look towards a brighter future.</t>
 <t id="102248">A short time ago I, Lieutenant Yisha Tarren of the Heart of Albion under the Argon Federation, signed a treaty with Governor Nakano. We can finally declare the Terran Conflict over.</t>
 <t id="102249">I'm glad that's over. I've never really been in the spotlight.</t>
 <t id="102250">And now we only have one war to worry about. I was talking with Nakano about how committed Canterans will be to the fight. They'll certainly help in DeVries securing the Jump Gate. But in Albion, they want to lie back a little and leave it to us.</t>
 <t id="102251">Right. We'll take it slow in Albion, but here, we're going to break out the big guns fast. We're gonna push this economy into overdrive! People like you are going to win us this war!</t>
 <t id="102252">It's all part of the top secret Heart of Albion plan. I'm sorry but you've not passed the initiate exam yet.</t>
 <t id="102253">Yeah, yeah. Just listen. We need to overwhelm Plutarch with everything we've got before their drone numbers become too much to handle. We already have a decent amount of fully-crewed ships which are just in need of repair. What we need are drones, lots of them.</t>
 <t id="102254">It may not be the best financial investment but it will be worth it. And the more we build, the less losses we take.</t>
 <t id="102255">Good. Thanks.</t>
 <t id="102256">Let's get started.</t>
 <t id="102257">We're off to a good start.</t>
 <t id="102258">It'll be a little tough getting all the resources we need, but we'll find a way.</t>
 <t id="102259">We need to deliver as many drones as we can to these ships.</t>
 <t id="102260">You need to get a capital ship first. Then we deliver the drones to them.</t>
 <t id="102261">That's right, just fill your capship with drones and we're all set.</t>
 <t id="102262">Aww, I spoiled the surprise. The Albion Skunk is designated to accompany this ship in the battle. We scout around, they hit what we tell them to.</t>
 <t id="102263">I'm not sure if we're ready.</t>
 <t id="102264">Any word from Borman?</t>
 <t id="102265">Governor. I think it's time we began to mobilise. We can send an encrypted databurst to the fleet in Albion and tell them when to attack. We have to time it just right, having our cap ships jump in as soon as we arrive from the highways. Any word on Reiver activity along the way?</t>
 <t id="102266">We'll give our fleets some time to prepare, then we move out.</t>
 <t id="102267">Let's make sure we're ready, then get into position.</t>
 <t id="102268">Nakano's making a fleet-wide broadcast.</t>
 <t id="102269">Receiving our mission specifics. Heh, we'll be right where the action is.</t>
 <t id="102270">You'd better not stay this quiet for the whole trip.</t>
 <t id="102271">Ok, now I'm getting a bit nervous.</t>
 <t id="102272">Don't get too far ahead.</t>
 <t id="102273">We're gonna fall behind.</t>
 <t id="102274">Don't forget that we need our capship in our squad.</t>
 <t id="102275">Everyone keep your form and continue for the station. Our ships will jump in any time.</t>
 <t id="102276">They see us coming. We have to get in fast and strike!</t>
 <t id="102277">Ren, look!</t>
 <t id="102278">Borman, don't over-commit. We can fight our way to you.</t>
 <t id="102279">Nakano's here!</t>
 <t id="102280">We'll do what we can.</t>
 <t id="102281">Ren, we need those drones deployed, now!</t>
 <t id="102282">Our drones are getting torn up!</t>
 <t id="102283">Our drones are tearing up that station!</t>
 <t id="102284">The station's going up!</t>
 <t id="102285">They're moving to protect the Plutarch ships!</t>
 <t id="102286">Plutarch and Reiver ships incoming!</t>
 <t id="102287">Borman, we have Reiver ships bearing down on us here. Can you assist?</t>
 <t id="102288">I...he's right Sir. I don't think we can hold for long.</t>
 <t id="102289">What about you?</t>
 <t id="102290">Good luck Falk.</t>
 <t id="102291">We've just lost two more ships! Damn it!</t>
 <t id="102292">Where's Nakano's ship? Did it jump out?</t>
 <t id="102293">(sad)We weren't ready. I thought we were ready.</t>
 <t id="102294">Best check on the stations as we go.</t>
 <t id="102295">(quiet, shocked)Ren. The gate.</t>
 <t id="102296">(alarmed)Chikusho! Ren!</t>
 <t id="102297">(panicked)Who are they, what the hell do we do?</t>
 <t id="102298">I really don't recognise those ships. What if they're not Argon? What if they're Terran? Or something else?</t>
 <t id="102299">(Playfully)Expanding are we?</t>
 <t id="102300">Acknowledged. We will coordinate with the freighter in the salvage operation.</t>
 <t id="102301">We don't have much time to waste. Let's check the situation on the other side of the gate.</t>
 <t id="102302">Sure. We'll back you up and then secure the Jump Beacon.</t>
 <t id="102303">We'll stay for a bit longer just to be sure.</t>
 <t id="102304">Latest reports say that a Jump Beacon may have been destroyed. We'll have no chance of escorting the capships once they've jumped.</t>
 <t id="102305">Let's try to keep the gate clear.</t>
 <t id="102306">Nice to see them rebuilding their infrastructure.</t>
 <t id="102307">Looks like they'll be able to shore up their defences with new ships soon.</t>
 <t id="102308">They shouldn't suffer any more food shortages with these new production lines.</t>
 <t id="102309">With the production up and running we should be able to pump out drones in no time.</t>
 <t id="102310">We can hole up near the gate incase we need to make a fast exit.</t>
 <t id="103001">Look at those cities. There must be millions on that planet.</t>
 <t id="103002">Take it slow.</t>
 <t id="103003">Omicron Lyrae?! Is she right?</t>
 <t id="103004">Borman said there were reports that Terran forces had invaded several Argon systems, including Omicron Lyrae. Defence and shipbuilding facilities were crippled. They were requesting reinforcements from Argon Prime. Nothing was heard after that.</t>
 <t id="103005">I wonder who won.</t>
 <t id="103006">Ship approaching. Let's hope the Argon won.</t>
 <t id="103007">Incoming Comms. Play it cool Ren.</t>
 <t id="103008">Admiral. This is Lieutenant Yisha Tarren. I serve with the remaining Argon Military in Albion. That system is called DeVries. We have allies caught in conflict and they need your help!</t>
 <t id="103009">The Plutarch Mining Corporation. They assumed power from the Argon Military soon after the gates closed. Now they are pushing into DeVries.</t>
 <t id="103010">Colonists. They call themselves Canterans. They've taken in Albion refugees and have joined our cause. There is also a hostile faction we call the Reivers. They've sided with Plutarch.</t>
 <t id="103011">Uh, of course, Admiral.</t>
 <t id="103012">Should we tell them about the Canterans?</t>
 <t id="103013">Ok. Shut up and let me do the talking.</t>
 <t id="103015">They're from Earth. They're Terran.</t>
 <t id="103016">Woah, let's not start throwing words like 'assault' around. These are good people. We've made our peace and they need your help. Argon and Terran civilians together, they all need your help!</t>
 <t id="103017">At least let us go with you, we know the system, the people.</t>
 <t id="103018">I've sent them our database and we've received the flight plan to the Jonferco station. I'm surprised that Jonferco still exists. That corporation was often hit by the Terrans during the war.</t>
 <t id="103019">Go back and do what? We just got beat! Still, look at where we are now; Omicron Lyrae. This system has fought of the Kha'ak, Terrans. Who knows what we'll find here to use against Plutarch.</t>
 <t id="103020">This system sure has seen a lot of action, generations of it. And the Argon never fell.</t>
 <t id="103021">I bet they've got all of their eggheads going over our database.</t>
 <t id="103022">How did you manage to land, speak for a few minutes and end up with bargain upgrades and a date with a CEO?</t>
 <t id="103023">This CEO Colbern is in another sector.</t>
 <t id="103024">Let's see what these engines can do!</t>
 <t id="103025">Are you sure you don't want those upgrades?</t>
 <t id="103026">Someone's in trouble.</t>
 <t id="103027">Not too far. It seems to be near a station.</t>
 <t id="103028">(alarmed)Those ships, Xenon!</t>
 <t id="103029">Argon reinforcements are jumping in.</t>
 <t id="103030">Xenon. Never thought I'd get to see one. You know the stories?</t>
 <t id="103031">Some would say evolved. That's why Beryll's research was so dangerous. These things turned into smart killing-machines.</t>
 <t id="103032">So, we have Xenon on one side and Plutarch on the other and we're running errands for corporations who don't want to help us.</t>
 <t id="103033">Where first?</t>
 <t id="103034">Looks like the freighter is waiting for us.</t>
 <t id="103035">Let's hope they don't keep us waiting.</t>
 <t id="103036">We've lost the ship. Looks like it sent out a distress call. Keep us alive Ren!</t>
 <t id="103037">Are you nuts?!</t>
 <t id="103038">We'd better lay low for a while.</t>
 <t id="103039">Are they preparing a full invasion? What chance do we have?</t>
 <t id="103040">I won't even bother explaining why it's a bad idea involving Plutarch. I'm not surprised they're looking out only for themselves.</t>
 <t id="103041">The last CEO of Plutarch?</t>
 <t id="103042">If he was assassinated, it would have been those against having a Teladi in such a prominent position in Argon space.</t>
 <t id="103043">They're fighting their own war, you can't expect them to leave their strongholds.</t>
 <t id="103044">(angry)You wouldn't dare! If they learn of Albion everyone there will be in danger.</t>
 <t id="103045">You're insane.</t>
 <t id="103046">Can you believe this? Our own people baiting the Xenon to Albion?</t>
 <t id="103047">I'll send a data-burst but I don't know who will pick it up.</t>
 <t id="103048">Most of the fleet is gone with Xenon swarming the whole sector. She's so out of her depth that she's not seeing straight.</t>
 <t id="103049">Too many ships are getting past. They'll be at the gate in less than a hour.</t>
 <t id="103050">The Xenon will tear this system apart if no-one is here to defend it.</t>
 <t id="103051">(angry)They're all mad! Leaving the system defenceless.</t>
 <t id="103052">I think we really need any advantage we can get. We should dock for those upgrades.</t>
 <t id="103053">Sounds like Bayes is making progress, they shouldn't be far.</t>
 <t id="103054">I wonder how many Xenon are on their way to Albion.</t>
 <t id="103055">I wouldn't object to destroying any Xenon we come across.</t>
 <t id="103056">Wow, they're moving fast.</t>
 <t id="103057">Looks like there's a dogfight over there.</t>
 <t id="103058">Let's keep pushing through.</t>
 <t id="103059">Woah, what's she shouting about?</t>
 <t id="103060">I've got their position. Let's get there in one piece.</t>
 <t id="103061">I'll give her some credit. They've secured the area pretty quickly.</t>
 <t id="103062">This is the last thing we needed.</t>
 <t id="103063">Looks like she's playing it safe. How about we get ahead of them and find this Split base first?</t>
 <t id="103064">We already know where it is. How about we take another look and see if we can find out what their plan is?</t>
 <t id="103065">I think I'll stay on the ship while you go down and negotiate. Have fun.</t>
 <t id="103066">So, we have a very lonely Split in the back of our ship, heading to Argon space. Why am I nervous?</t>
 <t id="103067">Isn't it strange how Bayes was all ready to charge headlong into a Xenon sector, but stops just because of one Split ship?</t>
 <t id="103068">But while she waits, Albion may be getting hit by Xenon.</t>
 <t id="103069">(sarcastic)Charming.</t>
 <t id="103070">Looks like the Navy has come to us. You'd better get back, Ren.</t>
 <t id="103071">This is Yisha Tarren. Can't we just focus on the Xenon?</t>
 <t id="103072">Hey, wait a minute. We didn't sign up for a lone suicide mission.</t>
 <t id="103073">We're ready for the test.</t>
 <t id="103074">Now that's just creepy.</t>
 <t id="103075">A little warning next time!</t>
 <t id="103076">What can we expect on the other side?</t>
 <t id="103077">No argument from me.</t>
 <t id="103078">Activating the Camouflage Device.</t>
 <t id="103079">Xenon getting close.</t>
 <t id="103080">Keep your distance.</t>
 <t id="103081">Don't draw attention.</t>
 <t id="103082">We've been spotted! We need to get out of here!</t>
 <t id="103083">Find a quiet place for me to work on the Camouflage Device.</t>
 <t id="103084">Let's try that again.</t>
 <t id="103085">...play it cool Ren. Let's not make them angry.</t>
 <t id="103086">I'm picking up the docks but they seem to be locked down. I'll mark where hack points may be.</t>
 <t id="103087">Can we question their motives (emphasis)after we blow it up?</t>
 <t id="103088">How about this? After we've planted the bomb and we get out of here, I'll send a communications burst. If someone answers, we've got a problem.</t>
 <t id="103089">I've modified our drones to give out the same signal to confuse the Xenon. I don't know how long it will last.</t>
 <t id="103090">We won't be able to dock without hacker drones.</t>
 <t id="103091">We'll have to abort and get more hacker drones.</t>
 <t id="103092">Almost done.</t>
 <t id="103093">OK. I think the dock was unlocked. Bring us in.</t>
 <t id="103094">How is it?</t>
 <t id="103095">I'm marking what appears to be a good place for the bomb.</t>
 <t id="103096">Get back as soon as you can. I think the Xenon are getting a little curious.</t>
 <t id="103097">The next station is marked up.</t>
 <t id="103098">Let's get this done, quick.</t>
 <t id="103099">Same deal as before.</t>
 <t id="103100">Not good. I say we've been made.</t>
 <t id="103101">Tell that to the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="103102">That's it, they're onto us!</t>
 <t id="103103">How are we playing this?</t>
 <t id="103104">It's not broken. The Xenon just aren't falling for it anymore.</t>
 <t id="103105">Ask the Split. They're their bombs.</t>
 <t id="103106">There's a dampening field. It may be blocking the detonation signal.</t>
 <t id="103107">If we take out a module or two, we may be able to get past it.</t>
 <t id="103108">Borman! It's about time.</t>
 <t id="103109">How about taking out some of the traffic?</t>
 <t id="103110">We should have a ship constructed.</t>
 <t id="103111">We'll help hold them off. Just bring the cavalry.</t>
 <t id="103112">So, we can freely go to Albion again.</t>
 <t id="103113">I think I've paid for myself thank you very much!</t>
 <t id="103114">Actually, how much is a co-pilot's salary?</t>

 <t id="101002">Can't help you there. I was out here looking for a replacement high-gain transmitter. It's probably best if we head to a station.</t>
 <t id="101003">We'll get going after I warm up the engines a bit.</t>
 <t id="101004">(after klaxon)Sorry about that. She does that sometimes. It's only some PMC ships exiting the highway.</t>

 <t id="101007">What the hell was that for? Those were Plutarch security ships! You don't just pull off a burn like that in their faces!</t>
 <t id="101008">She told me she was with the Heart of Albion. Sounds pretty respectable.</t>
 <t id="101009">How did you do that?</t>
 <t id="101010">She's been like this since I found her.</t>
 <t id="101011">How about we get you to that station.</t>
 <t id="101012">So, did you manage to contact anyone?</t>
 <t id="101013">Sure. Given how well the Skunk is performing it's the least I can do.</t>
 <t id="101014">Nothing stable. The odd job here and there. More to keep me busy than make money.</t>
 <t id="101015">My father worked for Plutarch Mining Corporation for many years.</t>
 <t id="101016">Seeing how stressed he became, I don't think corporate life is for me.</t>
 <t id="101017">He's gone now but he left me enough that I can choose what I want to do.</t>
 <t id="101018">This is Ren Otani. Yes, she's here.</t>
 <t id="101019">I'm sorry but I have to say I'm confused. You want her to stay here?</t>
 <t id="101020">So now what?</t>
 <t id="101021">I have a freighter parked up not too far away. How about we head there and you explain what this is all about.</t>
 <t id="101022">So, I assume this has something to do with the constant trouble Heart of Albion is getting into with Plutarch.</t>
 <t id="101023">I'm starting to think Borman didn't pay me enough.</t>
 <t id="101024">And then Plutarch came to power after the gates shutdown. You should be happy Plutarch even tolerates your group.</t>
 <t id="101025">There she is. I can't say I've used her for trading much. Never got around to finding a crew.</t>
 <t id="101026">No, I can't say they are. They're heading this way.</t>
 <t id="101027">I guess they saw a ship just sitting here and thought it would be an easy steal.</t>
 <t id="101028">Let me guess. You know just the guy.</t>
 <t id="101029">It's a little late for that. We have company.</t>
 <t id="101030">I don't suppose you could get the missile launcher working could you?</t>

 <t id="101033">How about we find a Defence Officer now.</t>
 <t id="101034">This isn't a warship. We've already got guns and missiles, what else is there?</t>
 <t id="101035">(refering to drones)It would be nice to get out of trouble from a distance.</t>
 <t id="101036">Steady on now, I'm not a hacky-go-lucky kind of guy.</t>
 <t id="101037">They don't have much in the way of firepower though.</t>
 <t id="101038">The Skunk isn't exactly a small target. Against shielded targets there's only so much I can do.</t>
 <t id="101039">Sounds like a plan.</t>
 <t id="101040">Happy to help. A mutual friend said you needed help.</t>
 <t id="101041">Yisha said you may have some old plasma weapons laying around.</t>
 <t id="101042">Well, don't expect me to use them on either one of you.</t>
 <t id="101043">Please, Captain, no need to be so formal. I'm hardly military.</t>
 <t id="101044">I'd invite you to stay, but I fear Plutarch would put me on their most wanted list.</t>
 <t id="101045">Are they following us?</t>
 <t id="101046">I don't really want to start a chase.</t>
 <t id="101047">That's quite a crowd gathering. There are some Plutarch ships approaching.</t>

 <t id="102020">My co-pilot, Yisha Tarren, is on board.</t>
 <t id="102021">Well, we were just out to explore, all peaceful like. We can't speak for our people but I expect we're looking for friendly relations, trade opportunities.</t>
 <t id="102022">Maybe we can help smooth over first contact. We go back, tell our people that you're here, that you're friendly. Then we can hope to get trade lanes open, I'm sure we can supply you with whatever you need.</t>

 <t id="102026">What? Are you sure?</t>
 <t id="102027">From the looks of it, neither are they.</t>
 <t id="102028">You think we should do something?</t>
 <t id="102029">Who are the Reivers?</t>
 <t id="102030">Who are you people?</t>
 <t id="102031">And the ships out there patrolling the sector. Some of them look, well, Terran.</t>
 <t id="102032">There are some war vets back home but it's just history to most now.</t>
 <t id="102033">She sure can, but there's still a lot of work to be done on her.</t>
 <t id="102034">And then?</t>
 <t id="102035">Before we can worry about getting these goods delivered, we have to find a way safely back to Albion.</t>
 <t id="102036">That's not much of a plan.</t>
 <t id="102037">We'll get there as soon as we can. Let us know what we need to do.</t>
 <t id="102038">We're sorry we couldn't do more.</t>
 <t id="102039">Look, Nakano. We'd really like to help and to travel to and from Albion freely but it may not be possible. Plutarch's locked down the gate and we're probably on their most wanted list.</t>
 <t id="102040">So, you think we should check out the gate area?</t>
 <t id="102041">Me neither. OK, we'll take a look.</t>
 <t id="102042">There could be a whole fleet on the other side!</t>
 <t id="102043">It's a little too easy. Where do you think the bulk of the Plutarch fleet is now?</t>
 <t id="102044">There's no one here, now what?</t>

 <t id="102046">What are you going to do? Start a war?</t>
 <t id="102047">I expect Yisha wants to fight, but not me. Maybe things would be better without Plutarch but, to do that, you're going to have to fight a lot of people, pilots, crewmen.</t>

 <t id="102084">I'm sure you'd find out sooner or later. We may as well be the ones to profit from it.</t>
 <t id="102085">Why bust prisoners out of a ship when we can steal it?</t>
 <t id="102086">We'll get there as soon as we can.</t>
 <t id="102087">He's already planning another engagement?</t>
 <t id="102088">Any idea what he wants to hit?</t>
 <t id="102089">Just barely.</t>
 <t id="102090">Please tell them that we're trying to get our ships back. You'd better let them know that things will be different now. What with trade runs to DeVries and Plutarch hunting us, things won't be as safe as before.</t>
 <t id="102091">Just tell me what you plan to do to Plutarch.</t>
 <t id="102092">And we just lost our people.</t>
 <t id="102093">What are you going to do now?</t>
 <t id="102094">Thank you Captain Borman. We'll put it to good use.</t>
 <t id="102095">You think he'll go for it?</t>
 <t id="102096">Do you think their economy can really handle another station eating into their resources?</t>
 <t id="102097">It's quite an investment but maybe it's worthwhile.</t>
 <t id="102098">Doesn't hurt. Alright, let's do it!</t>
 <t id="102099">(formal greeting)Captain Borman.</t>
 <t id="102100">What did you expect? Your fleet can't protect the people on the stations.</t>
 <t id="102101">What about all the asteroids here? The Canterans don't have the means to mine them anymore. We could send mining ships and split the ore 50-50.</t>
 <t id="102102">See if you can hail Nakano.</t>
 <t id="102103">A joint operation?</t>
 <t id="102104">Maybe he expects us to win.</t>
 <t id="102105">Sure, no point in just sitting here.</t>
 <t id="102106">Let's hope that gate doesn't open to a Xenon sector anytime soon.</t>
 <t id="102107">(alarmed)How the hell could they know? We'll be caught with our pants down.</t>
 <t id="102108">(waiting for enemies)I want to know the moment we can see them.</t>
 <t id="102109">How can you hope to enforce that? You have nothing close to their firepower.</t>
 <t id="102110">We'd better tell Borman as soon as we can. Maybe we should get face to face?</t>
 <t id="102111">Something wrong?</t>
 <t id="102112">They're just as Terran as the Argon were centuries ago when separated from Earth. Who knows, maybe we'll be one people in a decade or so; a new federation.</t>
 <t id="102113">Borman.</t>
 <t id="102114">Thanks to your mining ship crews. I just wish we could have saved everyone else.</t>
 <t id="102115">The people here are sympathetic to the Canterans? Do they know they're Terran?</t>
 <t id="102116">Governor Nakano has agreed to take in refugees but he wants a significant force to repel Plutarch for the time being.</t>
 <t id="102117">You'll commit that much.</t>
 <t id="102118">So what's next? How do we get all those ships through the gate?</t>
 <t id="102119">Do you know where any of them are? Can we get intel?</t>
 <t id="102120">We'll get it done.</t>
 <t id="102121">What do you think Plutarch and Beryll could be working on?</t>
 <t id="102122">It can't be anything on that scale. Maybe they're mass-producing drones.</t>
 <t id="102123">No-one here.</t>
 <t id="102124">Who are you?</t>
 <t id="102125">I'm Ren, this is Yisha. We need to know what Plutarch is planning with Beryll.</t>
 <t id="102126">You have Xenon tech?</t>
 <t id="102127">So, if there's no risk anymore, what's left to do?</t>
 <t id="102128">Got it. Where should we meet for the attack.</t>
 <t id="102129">We've not done anything wrong.</t>
 <t id="102130">This was a really, really bad idea.</t>
 <t id="102131">(jokingly)No ma'am.</t>
 <t id="102132">(Proud)Yeah. We've done good.</t>
 <t id="102133">You did great, everyone loved it. When was the last time you heard people celebrate like that?</t>
 <t id="102134">So they don't look like the 'Invading Terrans'?</t>
 <t id="102135">People like me? What exactly do you expect me to do?</t>
 <t id="102136">Good. That means you can't order me around.</t>
 <t id="102137">Easier to build and really useful in the fight. We'll lose a lot though.</t>
 <t id="102138">Don't worry, I'm with you on this.</t>
 <t id="102139">This is the last ship to fill, right?</t>
 <t id="102140">(Ren was just gifted a capship. Emphasis on 'My')My capship?!</t>
 <t id="102141">(excited)Nice to have another heavy-hitter on our side!</t>
 <t id="102142">Hello Governor.</t>
 <t id="102143">They'd better!</t>
 <t id="102144">(during battle)People are being picked off! We have no choice but to retreat!</t>
 <t id="102145">This is Otani. We're falling back to the Canteran sector. Watch each other's backs.</t>
 <t id="102146">Mark up ships that are falling behind. We'll try to help those we can.</t>
 <t id="102147">We got most people out of there. We'll double back and make sure we didn't leave anyone behind.</t>
 <t id="102148">I'm taking us to the station. Keep an eye out.</t>
 <t id="102149">(alarmed)There's another one.</t>
 <t id="102150">They've closed the comm.</t>
 <t id="102151">This is Ren Otani of the Albion Skunk. We're Argon. Can we talk about this?</t>
 <t id="102152">Looks like we don't have a choice!</t>
 <t id="102153">We're set. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="102154">Not just yet.</t>
 <t id="102155">Was your station heavily damaged? Is there anything we can help with?</t>
 <t id="102156">No point sitting around then. Let's travel to the Canterans. If we run into someone in trouble we'll lend a hand.</t>
 <t id="102157">We'll check it out.</t>
 <t id="102158">Is there anything we can do?</t>
 <t id="102159">Let's make sure our ships are in a safe place.</t>
 <t id="102160">That thing's a wreck.</t>
 <t id="102161">I'm going to assume it's not friendly.</t>
 <t id="102162">We best slip through as fast as possible.</t>
 <t id="103001">Sounds like she's just as lost as we are.</t>
 <t id="103002">I don't know. What state was Omicron Lyrae in when the gates shut down?</t>
 <t id="103003">I wonder if and when the fighting stopped.</t>
 <t id="103004">(cautiously)This is Ren Otani, captain of the Albion Skunk...from the Argon system of Albion.</t>
 <t id="103005">Of course Admiral. Myself and my co-pilot Yisha Tarren will do our best.</t>
 <t id="103007">That our new friends are Terran? Why not? They'll find out anyway.</t>
 <t id="103008">I think that's a mistake. If any of your pilots get trigger-happy at the sight of an unknown ship it could re-ignite the Terran Conflict.</t>
 <t id="103009">Alright. We'll make it available to you.</t>
 <t id="103011">Aren't you mad they're not letting us go back?</t>
 <t id="103012">I'm sure they just don't want any trouble.</t>
 <t id="103013">What could he want from us?</t>
 <t id="103014">(Irritated)On the other side of that gate there is a war going on. I don't think we have time to help an old guy find his friends who only yesterday may have been shooting at us.</t>
 <t id="103015">How can I say no? Look, just tell us where to find this Colbern guy; no promises that we go straight away though. It's been a rough day.</t>
 <t id="103016">I guess it's my charm.</t>
 <t id="103017">How far?</t>
 <t id="103018">I'll take us in a bit closer but let's not get in the way of the military.</t>
 <t id="103019">We're keeping our distance Admiral.</t>
 <t id="103020">We need a bit of help with that Admiral.</t>
 <t id="103021">Thank you Admiral.</t>
 <t id="103022">That the Terrans built them centuries ago to terraform planets, until they lost control of them.</t>
 <t id="103023">Let's hope the drones Plutarch constructed aren't so smart.</t>
 <t id="103024">Ren Otani. How can we help?</t>
 <t id="103025">Pretty much. Do you expect them to help us?</t>
 <t id="103026">Do you mean trade or military assets?</t>
 <t id="103027">We're certainly open for new trade agreements but this conflict isn't going to die down.</t>
 <t id="103028">If you can get us clearance to enter DeVries, I'm sure we can help smooth things over.</t>
 <t id="103029">Thank you.</t>
 <t id="103030">How did the Xenon get here?</t>
 <t id="103031">The military must have sent a fleet.</t>
 <t id="103032">What do Jonferco specialise in?</t>
 <t id="103033">Let's get started. What can we do to help?</t>
 <t id="103034">You want to invite competition?</t>
 <t id="103035">Will they need convincing?</t>
 <t id="103036">That sounds like a nice idea. Let's just hope the other corporations see it the same way.</t>
 <t id="103037">Thank you. The sooner we get aid to DeVries, the better.</t>
 <t id="103038">Colbern seemed confident they'll come around.</t>
 <t id="103039">The CHOW corporation.</t>
 <t id="103040">Are you having Xenon trouble?</t>
 <t id="103041">And they are?</t>
 <t id="103042">Lead the way.</t>
 <t id="103043">What can we even do?</t>
 <t id="103044">I'm sorry but he died soon after assuming control of Plutarch. Some say he was assassinated.</t>
 <t id="103045">We'll be there. Tell us where to go.</t>
 <t id="103046">We're staying right here. The longer this position is held, the longer the Xenon stay out of Albion.</t>
 <t id="103047">(Angry)But you'd better hit them hard because if we lose anyone in Albion because of you, you'll have more than the Xenon to worry about!</t>
 <t id="103048">They need to be warned.</t>
 <t id="103049">It depends on what damage they can do there.</t>
 <t id="103050">Let's just focus on what we can stop here.</t>
 <t id="103051">Need them for what?</t>
 <t id="103052">But he's right. All on our own here, we can't defend the system. At least we can help the Admiral take out the Xenon production, even if she is insane.</t>
 <t id="103053">Let's just focus on finding the rest of the military and putting an end to this.</t>
 <t id="103054">Woah, that's a Split Capship.</t>
 <t id="103055">I've never heard a Split argue (emphasis)against conflict before.</t>
 <t id="103056">Seeing as we're about to assault a Xenon sector, talking to Split is child's play.</t>
 <t id="103057">Ren Otani and Yisha Tarren. We are not with the Argon Military.</t>
 <t id="103058">Yes, we trade. What do you need?</t>
 <t id="103059">Pleased to meet you.</t>
 <t id="103060">There's no need for threats. We're not with the Argon Navy.</t>
 <t id="103061">Earning credits and killing Xenon if we can.</t>
 <t id="103062">I'm sure we can find a fellow Split on one of the Argon stations for you. But is this the time for a reunion? The Argon Navy is set to strike the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="103063">Are there any supplies you want to take back to your colony? We could gather some.</t>
 <t id="103064">She knows what to expect against the Xenon. She doesn't know how strong the Split are.</t>
 <t id="103065">This system has been through a lot in the past. I guess they're made of stern stuff.</t>
 <t id="103066">I'd be surprised if the Xenon are that stupid. I want to see it tested first.</t>
 <t id="103067">We can find some.</t>
 <t id="103068">We have some.</t>
 <t id="103069">Are you kidding?</t>
 <t id="103070">Woah! Our computer lists the Xenon as neutral.</t>
 <t id="103071">At the first sign of this going bad, I'm getting us out of here.</t>
 <t id="103072">Isn't it odd that the Xenon have taken over this station?</t>
 <t id="103073">I just wonder if anyone was on there when the Xenon came.</t>
 <t id="103074">It's... creepy.</t>
 <t id="103075">Planted.</t>
 <t id="103076">Is it me or are the Xenon paying closer attention to us?</t>
 <t id="103077">I'm bringing us in.</t>
 <t id="103078">As I said... creepy.</t>
 <t id="103079">How are things looking out there?</t>
 <t id="103080">We're not done yet.</t>
 <t id="103081">I'm getting us out of here!</t>
 <t id="103082">Prepare the cavalry. We're heading back.</t>
 <t id="103083">We didn't get them all.</t>
 <t id="103084">And without these stations, the Xenon can't reinforce their numbers?</t>
 <t id="103085">Any chance to get the Camouflage Device working again?</t>
 <t id="103086">Is there a plan?</t>
 <t id="103087">Borman must owe me a fortune for babysitting you all this time.</t>

 <t id="4940">I can do this on my own, no problem! Unless you like me to take my other ships as back-up! What's it to be?</t>
 <t id="4950">(Pilot sold his ship)I can go looking for job here. Unless you want me to stay on in another position, that is.</t>

 <t id="5113">(nothing found - aggressive)You're a disappointment. I was sure we were on to something.</t>
 <t id="5120">(contraband found - police)This is the police. You're in breach of the local contraband regulations.</t>
 <t id="5121">(contraband found - police)Well, it seems we have an over-ambitious pilot. Just follow our orders and deal with this properly.</t>
 <t id="5122">(drop instruction)Eject all contraband and we'll resolve this without any violence!</t>
 <t id="5130">(pirate plundering)We've hit pay-dirt! Look at that!</t>
 <t id="5131">(pirate plundering)See, I said he looked shifty and nervous!</t>

 <t id="1082">Well we're not where we were any more, are we? So what now?</t>
 <t id="1090">We won't get there with the fuel we've got.</t>

 <t id="1093">Fly slow, get fuel, jump. How can I stand the excitement?</t>
 <t id="1094">We're out of fuel. Send a tanker, and tell them to bring some beers too!</t>
 <t id="1095">Not enough fuel even to get to the fuel station. Great planning there!</t>
 <t id="1096">No fuel to jump. Trying to jump using generator only, but we know how well that usually turns out!</t>
 <t id="1097">I hate forced jumps, the generator grinds and showers sparks!</t>
 <t id="1098">Yes, yes. I'll go there just as soon as I have enough fuel to do so!</t>

 <t id="1109">Here's your choice. You choose it, we build it.</t>
 <t id="1110">Architect again. Your station is nearly ready. You will soon require a Station Manager to run it.</t>

 <t id="1113">(Ship builder)Do you want a new spaceship? I can fit you in now, if you want one.</t>
 <t id="1114">This is the ship? Once we start, your money has gone.</t>
 <t id="1115">Ship complete. It will cost you to leave it where it is.</t>
 <t id="1116">Can't you see we're busy? Come back later when I've got more time.</t>
 <t id="1117">Your ship will need a pilot. Get one here for when she completes or we charge you docking fees.</t>
 <t id="1118">We build these ships, take them or leave them.</t>
 <t id="1119">You haven't given us enough credits, yet. Duh!</t>
 <t id="1120">(PC: You take care of it.)Finally! We now have the credits to be able to get on.</t>
 <t id="1121">We do extensions. Some need others so they come in sets. Don't quibble!</t>
 <t id="1122">Tell us what upgrade levels you want. We aren't mind-readers!</t>
 <t id="1123">I get it, you want repairs. To what percentage level?</t>
 <t id="1124">These modules will fit now. If you don't see it, then don't ask for it!</t>
 <t id="1125">I can show you what resources I hold. Getting worried?</t>
 <t id="1126">(architect)You'll get back the credits that I don't use. Did you think I was going to keep them?</t>
 <t id="1151">(Initiate Trade)Done! We're on the way so don't waste our time!</t>

 <t id="1162">(Fail Sell Price)The selling price is awful here. I'll sell anyway unless you've a better plan.</t>
 <t id="1163">(Fail)That trade is not going to work here. Come up with something else.</t>
 <t id="1164">By some strange miracle, I've too many credits now. I'll transfer the surplus to you unless told otherwise.</t>
 <t id="1165">Deal made. I'll tell you about it sometime.</t>

 <t id="1208">Our current lack of collector drones might be a problem, do ya think?</t>
 <t id="1209">Our drones are collecting. I hope we aren't wasting them!</t>
 <t id="1210">Mining terminated. We'll tag along while you work out what to do next.</t>

 <t id="1095">We can't even get to the fuel station with what we have. We need resupply or a tug!</t>
 <t id="1096">We'll attempt a jump on generator power alone. I hope this works and we don't end up in Limbo!</t>
 <t id="1097">If we crank up the generator we can try to force a jump using that. We'll see how far we get. Wish us luck!</t>
 <t id="1098">We'll need to top up with fuel before making that kind of journey.</t>

 <t id="1093">We'll go and buy more fuel and then complete the jump. See you all whenever!</t>

 <t id="3013">(Hard 1)Are you sure you are suitable for this job?</t>
 <t id="3014">(Hard 2)Teladi is not convinced. Can you avoid loss of profits?</t>
 <t id="3015">(Fight Easy 1)This seems suitable for a shooter like you.</t>
 <t id="3016">(Fight Easy 2)You seem the type who likes to destroy stuff!</t>
 <t id="3017">(Fight Hard 1)I like your optimism, but I see much risk to profits here!</t>
 <t id="3018">(Fight Hard 2)I hope you have Teladi insurance. Soon your family collects on it, maybe!</t>
 <t id="3019">(Trade Easy 1)If you can shift standard goods, you are suitable.</t>
 <t id="3020">(Trade Easy 2)This is a simple stores run. It should be no issue for a pilot such as you.</t>
 <t id="3021">(Trade Hard 1)I seek a top freighter service. Can you provide that without loss of face?</t>
 <t id="3022">(Trade Hard 2)I have doubts that you can meet my standards. Can you show this Teladi is wrong?</t>

 <t id="3043">(Semi 1)Some credits will be given. Though no losses, yet there are few profits.</t>

 <t id="3052">(mission update 2)Your job details have changed. Please look at your system now.</t>

 <t id="3102">(Assassination Offer 2)This person must be stopped, by any means. Understand pilot?</t>
 <t id="3103">(Target)They sent you after me in hope of profits? This should be fun!</t>
 <t id="3104">(Target 2)You have no hope of success. You should not be silly!</t>

 <t id="3106">(Success)They stood no chance!</t>
 <t id="3107">(Fail)How did the target escape? You said you were skilled at this!</t>
 <t id="3108">(Fail by bribe)I suspect you make credits in side deal. You seek to out-deal Teladi?</t>

 <t id="3124">(Protect Ship Offer 2)I am in distress! I am being assaulted and look for assistance!</t>
 <t id="3141">(Police 1)I know that smugglers have used this area many times. I need an unmarked ship to get close and scan for such ships.</t>
 <t id="3142">(Success 1)Excellent. We can follow the leads and find the sources of the smuggling. That will save loss of credits.</t>
 <t id="3143">(Semi 1)You found no smugglers? That is sad, but not a total loss since they remain unaware of our surveillance.</t>
 <t id="3144">(Fail 1)So, you sat there doing nothing and still want us to pay you credits? You are insane!</t>
 <t id="3161">(Passenger Offer 1)I must make a deal somewhere else very soon. Can your ship transport Teladi that fast?</t>

 <t id="3000">(*Mission*)</t>
 <t id="3001">(General 1)Hello, Sir. Does this mission still suit you?</t>
 <t id="3002">(General 2)Hello, Sir. Will you still accept the mission?</t>
 <t id="3011">(Easy 1)You should have no issues with this easy task.</t>
 <t id="3012">(Easy 2)This task would not stress a novice pilot.</t>
 <t id="3013">(Hard 1)You seem unsure about this task. Are you really suitable?</t>
 <t id="3014">(Hard 2)Teladi remains unconvinced. Do you suit this mission or not?</t>
 <t id="3015">(Fight Easy 1)This seems suitable for a modest fighter.</t>
 <t id="3016">(Fight Easy 2)You seem the sort who enjoys breaking things!</t>
 <t id="3017">(Fight Hard 1)I fear your optimism might be misplaced!</t>
 <t id="3018">(Fight Hard 2)So, is my trust in you endangered by your brashness?</t>
 <t id="3019">(Trade Easy 1)A simple transportation mission. Any pilot should succeed at this.</t>
 <t id="3020">(Trade Easy 2)This is a simple movement of supplies. It should pose no problems for you.</t>
 <t id="3021">(Trade Hard 1)This needs a sharp transporter of goods. Is that you, or does it need someone else?</t>
 <t id="3022">(Trade Hard 2)I have doubts about your standards of service. You will impress me if you succeed at this job!</t>
 <t id="3023">(Acceptance Query 1)Still interested?</t>
 <t id="3024">(Acceptance Query 2)Is this still your choice?</t>
 <t id="3031">(Accept 1)Excellent! I surmised you would take it.</t>
 <t id="3032">(Accept 2)Accepted, that pleases me.</t>
 <t id="3033">(Reluctant 1)Teladi stays concerned. I can only hope that you can succeed.</t>
 <t id="3034">(Reluctant 2)You will require skill and luck for this. I am concerned you may lack both of these.</t>
 <t id="3035">(Reject 1)Sorry, I will not accept someone like you for this.</t>
 <t id="3036">(Reject 2)Not this time. You would most likely fail, and I would lose business contacts.</t>
 <t id="3037">(Info 1)Your system will soon have the job details.</t>
 <t id="3038">(Info 2)Details of the task will be shown on your ship system.</t>
 <t id="3041">(Success 1)Superb! Your success is much appreciated.</t>
 <t id="3042">(Success 2)Excellent! I trusted all along that you would succeed.</t>
 <t id="3043">(Semi 1)I will give you something as you made no loss, but the profits are marginal.</t>
 <t id="3044">(Semi 2)(*sigh*)This business was not a loss as a such. You have made minimal profits and so must expect few credits.</t>
 <t id="3045">(Fail 1)Was that supposed to be a serious attempt? You wasted prime business opportunities!</t>
 <t id="3046">(Fail 2)You are offensive to me! You waste time and profits!</t>
 <t id="3047">(Credits 1)I am transferring your profits now.</t>
 <t id="3048">(Reward 1)Please, take this as a bonus.</t>
 <t id="3050">(Client abort)Your services are not needed anymore. The client apologises.</t>
 <t id="3051">(mission update)There is a change of task details. See your system for the new details.</t>
 <t id="3052">(mission update 2)Your job details are being revised. Check your system now.</t>
 <t id="3101">(Assassination Offer 1)suppose I spoke of a target who needs to be removed from business. Somebody could make many credits - but not if the target ever resurfaced! Would you understand? Hmmm?</t>
 <t id="3102">(Assassination Offer 2)I have an issue with a threat to my business. A rival who needs to be taught a lesson, and permanently. Are we understanding each other?</t>
 <t id="3103">(Target)You see your chance of profits through assassinating me? This is madness!</t>
 <t id="3104">(Target 2)You assume I have no skills of my own? Prepare for a surprise!</t>
 <t id="3105">(Bribe 1)Teladi suggests a deal now can remove all risks of loss through combat. We can keep this secret, just amongst ourselves.</t>
 <t id="3106">(Success)So, that ends that annoyance!</t>
 <t id="3107">(Fail)How could the pilot escape? You claimed such combat skill!</t>
 <t id="3108">(Fail by bribe)Did the target make other offers. Did you accept? I must assume this took place.</t>
 <t id="3121">(Protect Station Offer 1)We have a hostile force attacking us. Please come and assist our defence forces. We will pay for protection of this station.</t>
 <t id="3122">(Protect Station Offer 2)This station is under assault and cannot be evacuated. Can you assist to save lives and profits?</t>
 <t id="3123">(Protect Ship Offer 1)Please help me resist these attackers! I need help fast!</t>
 <t id="3124">(Protect Ship Offer 2)General distress call! Help repel these assailants and share my profits!</t>
 <t id="3141">(Police 1)Smugglers use this route to send contraband deliveries. I need a stranger's ship to  close up and scan ships for illegal items.</t>
 <t id="3142">(Success 1)Splendid. We can follow these clues to track down all the smugglers. That will save many small businesses from seeing losses.</t>
 <t id="3143">(Semi 1)You discovered nothing suspicious? That is surprising, but it is not a loss as they remain unaware of our covert scanning.</t>
 <t id="3144">(Fail 1)You say you found nothing, yet we know they shipped illegal stuff by that route and missed by you. Get lost!</t>
 <t id="3161">(Passenger Offer 1)I must do business somewhere quite soon. Can you speed me to a different station?</t>
 <t id="3162">(Passenger Offer 2)I must leave here as quickly as possible. Will you transport me?</t>
 <t id="3163">(On Board)All secure back here. Teladi likes your ship; perhaps it is for sale? </t>
 <t id="3164">(Space)There is no space for me. You must find me a first class seat at once!</t>
 <t id="3165">(Late)You are so slow! Teladi soon dies of old age if you do not speed up!</t>
 <t id="3166">(Fail)You missed the deadline and I missed my business appointment. Drop me at the next station where I can mourn my losses!</t>
 <t id="3167">(Assigned to platform)Yes, Sir. I will go to my assigned post.</t>
 <t id="3181">(Sell Ware Offer 1)I need some items delivered as soon as possible. Interested?</t>

 <t id="3184">(Late Return)I still await those items. I must see them here on time!</t>
