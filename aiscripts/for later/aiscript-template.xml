<event_object_signalled object="this.ship" param="'travel jump prep'" param2="$destination" param3="$follower_list" comment="
  Signals Followers that this Ship wants to Jump to $destination - small craft may now register in $follower_list that they want to dock here before the Ship charges (they shall take care of this themselves) and remove themselves from the List when docked.
  Big Ships may add themselves to the List when they want to follow and they have Followers which have to dock first and remove themselves when their Followers are prepared"/>
<event_object_signalled object="this.ship" param="'travel jump start'" param2="$destination" comment="
  Signals Followers that this Ship wants to Jump to $destination - Jumpdrive now actually Charges (the fast charge, not the 10 minute slow one - that one will signal in the last 10s when Jumpdrive really starts) and Followers should do the same"/>
<event_object_signalled object="this.ship" param="'emergency jump'" param2="$destination" comment="
  Signals Followers that this Ship does an Emergency Jump immediately - other Big Ships may decide to follow or to continue Battle.
  Small Craft try to Dock while JD charges and will re-assign to another mothership if not successful or try to get back to their Group"/>
